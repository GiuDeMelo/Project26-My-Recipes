-> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees;
-> Stir the butter, garlic, parmesan and parsley together in a bowl;
-> Add the salt and season with pepper;
-> Cut deep slits into the bread then put it on a piece of foil (remember to not cut all the way through the loaf);
-> Use a teaspoon to spread the mixed butter inside each slit;
-> Wrap the loaf in the same piece of foil then place on a baking sheet and bake it for 15 minutes;
-> After it's baked, remove the bread from the oven and unwrap the top but keep it on the foil;
-> Add mozzarella in each slit;
-> Take the loaf to the oven once again for 5 minutes;
 Ready to serve! :D
